  The Spelling Practice App, built with Flutter, helps users improve spelling 
  through interactive practice sessions. Users can create custom word lists and 
  use a text-to-speech feature to learn proper pronunciation. The app randomly 
  selects words for users to spell, provides immediate feedback, tracks progress 
  with scores, allows review of correct words, and offers session restart options. 
  Its intuitive interface supports repeating challenging words and retrying 
  opportunities for both childrenâ€™s education and adult vocabulary enhancement. 
  Utilizing Dart programming principles along with Material Design elements for 
  a modern look, it leverages the Flutter TTS library for strong speech support.
