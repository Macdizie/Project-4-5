# - Generate a random number between 1 and 250.

# - Define a maximum number of attempts (9) that the player has to guess the correct number.

# Game Loop:
# - Implement a for loop to allow the player to guess up to 9 times.
for guessesTaken in range(1, 10):

    # - Prompt the player to enter their guess.

    else:
        # - If the guess is correct, break out of the loop.

# Win or Lose:
# - If the player's guess is correct, display a congratulatory message and the number of attempts taken.
